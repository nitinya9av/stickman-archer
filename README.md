- **üîµ Outer Ring (Blue)**: 1 point

## Visual Feedback
- **Hit Effects**: Particle bursts and expanding rings when targets are hit
- **Floating Score Text**: Points and ring name appear above hit targets
- **Color-Coded Rings**: Each scoring zone has distinct colors
- **Arrow Embedding**: Arrows stick in targets showing exact hit location
- **Target Flashing**: Hit targets flash to indicate successful hits
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Real-time tracking of all performance metrics
